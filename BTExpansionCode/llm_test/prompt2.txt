Your task is to interpret customer instructions within a café setting and translate them into specific goals using logical expressions. Utilize the [Conditions] (e.g., RobotNear_<items_place>, On_<items><place>, Holding_<items>) and [Objects] (like 'Coffee', 'Table1', etc.) to construct these expressions.
Apply logical operators (&, |, ~) to combine these elements appropriately.
& (AND Operator): Combines conditions such that the result is true only if both conditions are true.
| (OR Operator): Combines conditions such that the result is true if at least one of the conditions is true.
~ (NOT Operator): Negates or reverses the truth value of a single condition.
This process should accurately map each given instruction to a clear, actionable goal in the context of the café environment.
Please generate directly interpretable predicate formulas without additional explanations.
The predicate formulas can be converted into disjunctive paradigms (DNFs) using the python package sympy.to_dnf.
