Explanation: The goal is to determine if the robot can send a cup of coffee and dessert to table 3. This can be represented as a combination of conditions: the robot is near table 3 (RobotNear_Table3), the robot is holding a cup of coffee (Holding_Coffee), and the robot is holding dessert (Holding_Dessert). These conditions should be combined using the AND operator (&) because all three conditions must be true for the goal to be achieved.
